Warlock2D
==================

An idea for a game based on HTML5 canvas, Websockets, NodeJS based on the Warcraft 3 mod Warlocks.

You act as a warlock with an arsenal of several spells to defeat your enemies. The battle ground is a round circle which shrinks over time in order to increase the intensity of the game. Spells made by every Warlock in the game pushes and damages other warlocks in order to either kill them via raw damage or push them outside the ring and thus letting the lava outside the ring inflict huge damage over time.Last man standing wins.

In the original Walockbrawl mod for Warcraft 3 there are a bunch of spells, but for simplicity only a few chosen ones get picked out to ensure stability and smoothness.

Spells:
==================

Fireball
Blink
Lightning
Melee Push

==================

More spells will of course be added later on.

Controls:
==================

Moving around the battleground will be accomplished with right click of the mouse while casting a spell will be done through the key for the spell e.g. G for Fireball and then the left mouse button to fire it in the mouse cursors direction. Upon collission with another warlock, damage will be dealt and the target warlock will be pushed back for some distance.

==================

In the original game there is a possibility to purchase items and upgrade spells. This issue will be dealt with later when basic mechanics and logics are implemented.
